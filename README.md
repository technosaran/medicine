## Configuration

### Gemini API Setup
1. The application stores your API key locally in browser storage
2. Your API key is never sent to any server except Google's Gemini API
3. You can update your API key anytime in the chat interface

### Video Consultation Setup
- Uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer video communication
- Includes STUN servers for NAT traversal
- For production use, consider adding TURN servers for better connectivity

## Usage Examples

### AI Health Assistant
```
User: "I have a headache and feel nauseous. What could this be?"

AI: "Headaches combined with nausea can have several causes:

**Common causes:**
- Tension headaches
- Migraine
- Dehydration
- Stress or lack of sleep

**When to seek immediate care:**
- Severe, sudden headache
- Fever with headache
- Vision changes
- Neck stiffness

I recommend staying hydrated, resting in a quiet, dark room, and monitoring your symptoms. If symptoms worsen or persist, please consult a healthcare professional."
```

### Medical Image Analysis
```
User uploads an X-ray image with question: "Please check this chest X-ray for any abnormalities"

AI: "**Image Analysis - Chest X-ray**

**Observations:**
- Clear lung fields with normal lung markings
- Heart size appears within normal limits
- No obvious masses or consolidations visible
- Bone structures appear intact

**Assessment:**
- The chest X-ray appears to show normal findings
- No immediate abnormalities detected in this view

**Recommendations:**
- This analysis is for informational purposes only
- Always have medical images reviewed by a qualified radiologist
- If you have symptoms, consult with your healthcare provider
- Consider follow-up imaging if clinically indicated

**Important:** This AI analysis cannot replace professional radiological interpretation."

3. For HTTPS (required for camera access), use tools like:
   - `python -m http.server 8000` (then use ngrok for HTTPS)
   - Live Server extension in VS Code
   - Local development servers with SSL certificates

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues

If the API test fails, try these steps:

1. **Use the API Test Tool**
   - Open `test-api.html` in your browser
   - Follow the step-by-step testing process
   - Check the browser console for detailed error messages

2. **Common API Issues**
   - **Invalid API Key**: Get a new key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - **Quota Exceeded**: Check your API usage limits
   - **CORS Issues**: Serve files from a local web server (not file://)
   - **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection

3. **API Key Setup**
   - Ensure you're using a valid Gemini API key (not other Google API keys)
   - The key should start with "AIza..."
   - Make sure the key has proper permissions enabled

4. **Browser Console Debugging**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check the Console tab for error messages
   - Look for network errors in the Network tab

### Running Locally

For best results, serve the files using a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then access via `http://localhost:8000`

## Support

For issues and questions:
1. **First**: Use `test-api.html` to diagnose API issues
2. Check the browser console for error messages
3. Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has quota
4. Verify camera/microphone permissions for video features
5. Test with different browsers if issues persist
